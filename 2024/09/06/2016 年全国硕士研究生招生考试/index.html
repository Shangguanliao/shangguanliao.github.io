<p>Happy people work differently. They’re more productive, more creative, and willing to take greater risks. And new research suggests that happiness might influence    1     firms work, too.</p>
<p>Companies located in places with happier people invest more, according to a recent research paper.  2  ,  firms  in  happy  places  spend  more  on  R&amp;D  (research and development). That’s because happiness is linked to the kind of longer-term thinking     3     for making investments for the future.</p>
<p>The researchers wanted to know if the    4    and inclination for risk-taking  that  come with happiness would    5    the way companies invested. So they   compared U.S. cities’ average  happiness   6    by  Gallup  polling  with  the investment activity of publicly traded firms in those areas.</p>
<pre><code>7enough, firms’ investment and R&amp;D intensity were correlated with the happiness of the  area  in which they were 8. But is it really happiness that’s linked to investment, or could something else about happier cities 9 why firms there spend more on R&amp;D? To find out, the researchers  controlled  for  various 10that might make firms more likely to invest – like size, industry, and sales  – and for  indicators  that a place was 11to live in, like growth in wages or population. The link between happiness and investment generally   12  even after accounting for these things.
</code></pre>
<p>The correlation between happiness and investment was particularly strong for younger firms, which the authors    13    to “less codified decision making process” and the possible presence of “younger and less    14    managers who are more likely to be  influenced by  sentiment.” The relationship was  15   stronger in places   where happiness was spread more  16  .  Firms seem to  invest  more in  places where most people are relatively happy, rather than in places with happiness inequality.</p>
<pre><code>17    this doesn’t prove that happiness causes firms to invest more or to    take a longer-term view, the authors believe  it at least     18     at that possibility.  It’s not hard to imagine that local culture and sentiment would help  19    how executives think about the future. “It surely seems plausible that happy people would be more forward-thinking and creative and   20   R&amp;D more than the  average,” said one researcher.

<h2 id="Text-1"><a href="#Text-1" class="headerlink" title="Text 1"></a><strong>Text 1</strong></h2><p>It’s true that high-school coding classes aren’t essential for learning computer science in college. Students without experience can catch up after a few  introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science.</p>
<p>However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it’s not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers – but a tool to build apps, or create artwork,  or test hypotheses. It’s  not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.</p>
<p>Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the  brim,  which can drive the less-experienced or -determined students away.</p>
<p>The Flatiron School, where  people  pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that’s become popular for adults  looking  for  a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but “we try to gear lessons toward things they’re interested in,” said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance,  one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies  based   on your mood.</p>
<p>The students in the Flatiron class probably won’t drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the “Ruby on Rails” language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn – how to think logically through a problem and organize the results – apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers  – in their pockets, in their offices, in their homes – for  the rest of their lives. The younger they learn how computers think, how to coax   the machine into producing what they want – the earlier they learn  that they have the power to do that – the better.</p>

<h2 id="Text-2"><a href="#Text-2" class="headerlink" title="Text 2"></a><strong>Text 2</strong></h2><p>Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens  – a kind  of bird living on stretching grasslands – once lent red to the often grey landscape    of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species’ historic range.</p>
<p>The crash was a major reason the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) decided to formally list the bird as threatened. “The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation,” said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as “endangered,” a status that gives federal officials greater  regulatory  power  to crack down on threats. But Ashe and others argued that the “threatened” tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservation approaches. In particular, they called for forging  closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy  with  federal action, and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of  the prairie chicken’s habitat.</p>
<p>Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowners or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as  long as they had signed a range-wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat. The fund will   also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat. USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average  of  67,000 birds over the next 10 years. And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let “states remain in the  driver’s seat  for managing the species,” Ashe said.</p>
<p>Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric. Some Congress members are trying  to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court. Not  surprisingly,  industry groups and states generally argue it goes too far; environmentalists say it doesn’t go far enough. “The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction,” says biologist Jay Lininger.</p>

<h2 id="Text-3"><a href="#Text-3" class="headerlink" title="Text 3"></a><strong>Text 3</strong></h2><p>That everyone’s too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully: There’s never any time to read.</p>
<p>What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don’t seem sufficient. The web’s full of articles offering tips on making time to read: “Give up TV” or “Carry a book with you at all times.” But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn’t work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning – or else you’re so exhausted that a challenging book’s the last thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, “is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication… It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually <em>inclined</em>  to interruption.” Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can’t be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.</p>
<p>In fact, “becoming more efficient” is part of the problem. Thinking of time as  a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any  given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some  goal. Immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it in as a to-do list item and you’ll manage only goal-focused reading – useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. “The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,” writes Gary Eberle  in his book <em>Sacred Time</em>, and “we  feel  a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes) as they pass,  for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them.” No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.</p>
<p>So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for  reading. You’d think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us “step outside time’s flow” into “soul time.” You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. “Carry a book with you at all times” can actually work, too – providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you’re “making time to read,” but just reading, and making time for everything else.</p>

<h2 id="Text-4"><a href="#Text-4" class="headerlink" title="Text 4"></a><strong>Text 4</strong></h2><p>Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.</p>
<p>Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.</p>
<p>Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.</p>
<p>From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually  all  aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns  to  politics.</p>
<p>Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life  than it was for earlier generations. While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those “just getting started in life” face a tougher climb than earlier generations in reaching such signpost achievements as securing    a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding  affordable housing.</p>
<p>Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-year-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs, says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily, he said, “I can’t afford to pay my monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to make that happen.” Looking back, he is struck that his parents  could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young. “I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn’t have college degrees,” Schneider  said.  “I  don’t think people are capable of that anymore.”</p>

Yet children appear to have it down to an art – and for the most part they don’t need self-help books or therapy. Instead, they look after their wellbeing instinctively, and usually more effectively than we do as grownups. Perhaps it’s time to learn a few lessons from them.</p>
<ol start="41">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What does a child do when he’s sad? He cries. When he’s angry? He shouts. Scared? Probably a bit of both. As we grow up,  we learn  to control our  emotions so they are manageable and don’t dictate our behaviours, which is in many ways a good thing. But too often we take this process too far and end up suppressing emotions, especially negative ones. That’s about as effective as  brushing  dirt under a carpet and can even make us ill. What we need to do is find a way to acknowledge and express what we feel appropriately, and then – again, like  children – move on.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of Christmases ago, my youngest stepdaughter, who was nine years old at the time, got a Superman T-shirt for Christmas. It cost less than a fiver but  she was overjoyed, and couldn’t stop talking about it. Too often we believe that a new job, bigger house or better car will be the magic silver bullet that will allow    us to finally be content, but the reality is these things have  very  little  lasting impact on our happiness levels. Instead, being grateful for small things every day</p>
<p>is a much better way to improve wellbeing.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Have you ever noticed how much children laugh?  If we adults  could indulge in a bit of silliness and giggling, we would reduce the stress hormones in our  bodies, increase good hormones like endorphins, improve blood flow to our hearts and even have a greater chance of fighting off infection. All of which would, of course, have a positive effect on our happiness levels.</p>
<ol start="44">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with being a grownup is that there’s an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with – work, mortgage payments, figuring out what to cook for dinner. But as adults we also have the luxury of being able to control our own diaries and it’s important that we schedule in time to enjoy the things we  love. Those  things  might be social, sporting, creative or completely random (dancing around  the  living room, anyone?) – it doesn’t matter, so long as they’re enjoyable, and not likely to have negative side effects, such as drinking too much alcohol or going on   a wild spending spree if you’re on a tight budget.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>_______________________________</li>
</ol>
<p>Having said all of the above, it’s important to add that we shouldn’t try too hard to be happy. Scientists tell us this can backfire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing. As the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said: “Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.” And in that, once more, we need to look to the example of our children, to whom happiness is not a goal but a natural byproduct of the way they live.</p>

<p>The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors. The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you’ll see, and the more stuff you see, the more you’ll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,000 different items, and many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to  brain-scan  experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective,  and instead begin  shopping emotionally – which is  the point  at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.</p>

<p>超市的设计就是要诱使顾客尽可能久地待在店内。其理由很简单：你在店里逗留越久，看到的东西就越多，看到的东西越多，买的就越多。而超市里的东西多得很。按食品营销研究院所说，普通超市售卖约44，000种各式货品，而且许多超市的货品还要多出成千上万种。单是可供选择的货品数量就足以让购物者陷入信息超负荷的状态。根据大脑扫描实验，如此之大的决策量带来的负担会很快令我们无法承受。购物约40分钟后，大多数人就不再费心去理性选购，而是开始冲动购物了——就是从这一刻起，我们把本来根本没打算买的那一半东西堆进了购物车。</p>
